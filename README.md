# Business Analytics Internship - Cognifyz Technologies

This repository contains the work completed during my Business Analytics Internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**. The project showcases my skills in data analysis, data cleaning, and visualization, with a focus on exploring investment information sources.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze a dataset related to various sources of investment information. Key tasks include:

- Loading and inspecting the dataset.
- Cleaning and transforming the data to ensure accuracy.
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights.
- Visualizing the findings using bar charts and other relevant plots.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on how participants access investment knowledge, categorized by source types such as **Financial Consultants**, **Newspapers**, **Television**, and **Internet**.

### Key Insights:

- **Most common source:** Financial Consultants (16 occurrences)
- **Newspapers and Magazines:** 14 occurrences
- **Television and Internet:** Lower frequencies compared to Financial Consultants.

## Project Structure

The main components of the repository are:

- **`Cognifyz Technologies Business Analytics Internship.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow, from loading the dataset to analysis and visualization.
